      <p>
     one of the colest fish are is a discus.
      It comes from the amazon rainforest in south america and has many different colors and different designs.
     It can grow to a size of a dinner plate in the wild.
          And in captivity they can grow the size of a smaller plate.
          when their in the wild they live near the banks in brackish water and hide in the plants and eat them.
          but the are ommnivores so hey will also eat small bugs.
          When their in captivity they need plants no mater where they are to hide in. 
          They eat plants but what makes them even healthier is turkey heart.
          And they are a type  of community fish.
